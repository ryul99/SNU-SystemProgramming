# Homework 2 - Warming Up

In this homework, you are going to
*  learn the basic code editing cycle with Git
*  learn the basics of GNU make and
*  write a simple C program

[[_TOC_]]

## Before you begin

Always, **ALWAYS** start by forking a project (homework, lab) into your own private namespace! If you work on the original repository, all your changes will be visible to everyone.

To do so, hit the "Fork" button to the right of the project title, then select your namespace. Check that the visibility of your personal fork is set to **private** (Settings -> General -> Visibility). Do not share your repositories with anyone - this is considered cheating and will be penalized.

## Introduction to Git

If you are unfamiliar with Git, have a look at the [Introduction to Git](INTRO_GIT.md).

## Introduction to GNU Make

If you are unfamiliar with GNU Make, have a look at the [Introduction to GNU Make](INTRO_MAKE.md).


## Your Task

The handout includes a `Makefile` and a skeletton of a C file, `make.c`. A binary of the solution is provided in `hw2.reference` so that you can compare your code to ours.

### Task 1

Modify `main.c` such that it prints all command line arguments as follows:
```bash 
$ ./hw2.reference hello there
Command line arguments (3 total):
   0: './hw2.reference'
   1: 'hello'
   2: 'there'
```

The number of arguments is provided in `argc`, the arguments themselves in `argv[]` of main:
```C
...
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
...
```

Add a loop after the first `TODO` in the code that first prints the string `Command line arguments (# total):` where # is replaced with the actual number of arguments. Then, add a loop (for or while) that runs through all arguments from `i=0...argc-1` and prints each argument `argv[i]`.

In the shell, compile your program using `make`. Stage the modified file and commit the solution to task 1 to your local Git repository.

### Task 2

In this second task, we want to add up all the numbers provided on the command line and print their sum. For example
```bash
$ ./hw2.reference 2021 9 8
Command line arguments (4 total):
   0: './hw2.reference'
   1: '2021'
   2: '9'
   3: '8'

Sum of arguments: 2038.
```

You can assume that all arguments (except argument 0 which always contains the filename of the program) are integer numbers. No error checking is needed.

To convert a string to an integer, use the `atoi()` function. You can learn how to use `atoi()` from the man pages: `man atoi`.

Add a loop that goes from `i=1..argc-1` and adds up the integer value of each argument. At the end, print the sum.

In the shell, compile your program using `make`. Stage the modified file and commit the solution to task 2 to your local Git repository.

### Task 3

We want to implement the addition in our own custom math library. For that purpose, we define a header file and implement the corresponding C file.

The header file is given here, you can simply copy-paste it into `mathlib.h`:
```C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// System Programming                     Homework #2                                    Fall 2021
//
/// @file
/// @brief math library header file
/// @author <yourname>

/// @brief returns the sum of two integer values
/// @param a term a
/// @param b term b
/// @retval sum of a + b
int add(int a, int b);
```
In case you are wondering what the funny symbols in the comments are: these are [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)-style comments. You can run `make doc` to generate HTML documentation for this homework. Use Firefox to browse the documentation (`firefox doc/html/index.html`).

Implement the function `add()` in `mathlib.c`, then replace the addition (`+`) in `main.c` with a call to `add()`. Do not forget to include the header file of our math library at the beginning of `main.c`:
```C
#include "mathlib.h"
```

Now compile your project first using `gcc` directly
```bash 
$ gcc -o hw2 main.c mathlib.c
```
If all is good you will see no compilation errors. If there are errors, fix them.

Next try to compile the project using make. First run `make mrproper` to clean all files, then compile:
```bash
$ make mrproper
rm -f main.o main.d
rm -f hw2
$ make
set -e; rm -f main.d; gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2 -MM main.c | sed 's/\(main\)\.o[ :]*/\1.o main.d: /' > main.d
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2   -c -o main.o main.c
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2 -o hw2 main.o
main.o: In function `main':
main.c:(.text.startup+0x7): undefined reference to `add'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
Makefile:70: recipe for target 'hw2' failed
make: *** [hw2] Error 1
```

The problem is that the Makefile does not contain a rule to compile mathlib.c. Open the Makefile and inspect it. You need to add `mathlib.c` in one location only to make the compilation process work:
```bash
$ make 
set -e; rm -f mathlib.d; gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2 -MM mathlib.c | sed 's/\(mathlib\)\.o[ :]*/\1.o mathlib.d: /' > mathlib.d
set -e; rm -f main.d; gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2 -MM main.c | sed 's/\(main\)\.o[ :]*/\1.o main.d: /' > main.d
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2   -c -o main.o main.c
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2   -c -o mathlib.o mathlib.c
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -O2 -o hw2 main.o mathlib.o
```

Test your work, then stage the modified and new files and commit the solution to task 3 to your local Git repository.


## Submission

If you have committed your work as instructed at the end of tasks 1-3, you can submit your solution by pushing your commits to the Gitlab server:
```bash
$ git push
