# Lab 2: I/O

In this lab, we implement a tool that lists all files in a directory and all its subdirectories.

You will learn
   * how to retrieve files in a directory
   * how to retrieve the metadata of a file
   * how to print nicely formatted output
   * that exception handling takes a significant effort
   * that string handling is not one of C's strenghs
   * and a bunch of other useful programming tricks and C library functions

## Important Dates

| Date | Description |
|:---  |:--- |
| Wednesday, September 15, 18:30 | I/O Lab hand-out |
| Friday, September 24, 16:30 | I/O Lab session 1 |
| Wednesday, September 29, 18:30 | I/O Lab session 2 |
| Sunday, October 3, 12:00 | Submission deadline |


## Logistics

### Hand-out
The lab is handed out via https://teaching.csap.snu.ac.kr/system-programming-fall-2021/lab/lab-2-io.

Start by forking the lab into your namespace, then **make sure that the lab's visibility is set to private**. Read the instructions here carefully. 
Finally, clone the lab to your local computer and get to work. 

### Submission

Commit and push your work frequently to avoid data loss. Once you are happy with your solution and want to submit it for grading, create a tag called "Submission". **The timestamp of the "Submission" tag is considered your submission time**.

To create a tag, go to your I/O lab repository on https://teaching.csap.snu.ac.kr/ and navigate to Repository -> Tags. Enter "Submission" as the Tag name then hit "Create tag". You can leave the other fields empty.  

If you later discover an error and want to update your submission, you can delete the "Submission" tag, fix your solution, and create a new "Submission" tag. If that happens _after_ the submission deadline, you also need to email the TAs so that they are aware of the update to your submission.


## Dirtree Overview

Our tool is called _dirtree_. Dirtree recursively traverses a directory tree and prints out a sorted list of all files.

```
$ dirtree demo
demo
  subdir1
    sparsefile
    thisisanextremelylongfilenameforsuchasimplisticfile
 subdir2
    brokenlink
    symboliclink
  subdir3
    pipe
    socket
  one
  two

```

Dirtree can also print a fancy directory tree and show details...
```
$ dirtree -t -v demo
demo
|-subdir1                                                  devel:devel           4096         8  d

```

Last but not least, dirtree can generate aggregate totals over several directories:
```
$ dirtree -v -s demo/subdir1 demo/subdir2

## Dirtree Specification 

### Command line arguments

Dirtree accepts the following command line arguments
```
dirtree [Options] [Directories]
```

| Option      | Description |
|:----        |:----        |
| -h          | Help screen |
| -t          | Turn on fancy tree view |
| -v          | Turn on verbose mode |
| -s          | Turn on summary mode |

`Directories` is a list of directories that are to be traversed. Dirtree accepts up to 64 directories.
If no directory is given, then the current directory is traversed. 

### Operation

1. Dirtree traverses each directory in the list `Directories` recursively. 
2. In each directory, it enumerates all directory entries and prints them in alphabetical order. Directories are listed before files. The special entries '.' and '..' are ignored.
3. A summary is printed after each directory. If several directories are traversed, an aggregate total is printed at the end.

### Output

#### Simple mode vs. fancy tree view mode
As dirtree traverses the directory tree, it prints the names of the sorted entities in a directory. The names are indented according to the level of the subdirectory. For each additional level, the names are shifted right two positions to allow for easy visual identification of the directory structure.

**Simple mode** indents names by two spaces for each additional level.
**Fancy tree mode** prints a tree structure using only ASCII characters.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Simple mode</th>
      <th align="left">Fancy tree view mode</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>dir             <br>  subdir1<br>    subdir2<br>      file1<br>      file2<br>      file3<br>  file4</pre>
      </td>
      <td>
        <pre>dir             <br>|-subdir1<br>| `-subdir2<br>|   |-file1<br>|   |-file2<br>|   `-file3<br>`-file4</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Detailed mode
In detailed mode, dirtree prints out the following additional details for each entry:
* User and group  
  Each file in Unix belongs to a user and a group. Detailed mode prints the names of the user and the group separated by a colon (:).
* Size  
  The size of the file in bytes.
* Disk blocks  
  The number of blocks this file occupies on the disk. 
* File type  
  Indicates the type of file by a single character

  | Type | Character |
  |:---  |:---------:|
  | File | _(empty)_ |
  | Directory | d |
  | Link | l |
  | Character device | c |
  | Block device | b |
  | Fifo | f |
  | Socket | s |


#### Summary mode
In summary mode, dirtree prints a header and footer around each directory and a one-liner containing statistics about the directory.

If there are more than one directories provided on the command line, an aggregate total of all listed directories is shown.
```
$ dirtree -s demo/subdir1 demo/subdir3

Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
demo/subdir1
  subdir2
    file1
    link

Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
demo/subdir3
  file2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 file, 0 directories, 0 links, 0 pipes, and 0 sockets

Analyzed 2 directories:
  total # of files:                       2
  total # of directories:                 1
  total # of links:                       1
  total # of pipes:                       0
  total # of socksets:                    0
```



#### Output formatting
The output in simple mode prints all elements with the correct indentation. 
In detailed mode, the output is nicely formatted and filenames that are too long are cut and end with three dots (...). 
Unless explicitly specified, you can decide for yourself whether and how you are formatting exceptional cases (error messages, etc.)

```
$ dirtree -v -s demo2

```

The output in detailed mode consists of the following elements:

| Output element | Width | Alignment | Action on overflow |
|:---            |:-----:|:---------:|:---      |
| Path and name  | 54    | left      | cut and end with three dots |

```

##### Summary line
dirtree takes great care to output grammatically correct English. Zero or >=2 elements are output in plural form, while for exactly one element the singular form is used.
Compare the two summary lines:
```
0 files, 2 directories, 1 link, 1 pipe, and 1 socket

1 file, 1 directory, 2 links, 0 pipes, and 5 sockets
```

### Error handling

Errors that occur when processing a directory (permission errors) are reported in place of the entries of that directory:
```
$ dirtree -v /etc/cups
/etc/cups
  ...
  interfaces                                                root:lp              4096         8  d
    ERROR: Cannot allocate memory
  ppd                                                       root:lp              4096         8  d
    .keep_net-print_cups-0                                  root:root               0         0   
  ssl                                                       root:lp              4096         8  d
     ERROR: Permission denied
  client.conf                                               root:root              31         8   
  ...
```

If an error occurs when retrieving the meta data of a file, the error message is printed inplace of the file's meta data:
```
$ dirtree -v /proc/self/fd
/proc/self/fd
  0                                                        devel:devel             64         0  l
  1                                                        devel:devel             64         0  l
  2                                                        devel:devel             64         0  l
  3                                                     No such file or directory
```

For any other errors, you can choose what to do. The reference implementation aborts on most errors:
```
$ dirtree -s -v demo
Name                                                        User:Group           Size    Blocks Type

## Handout Overview

The handout contains the following files and directories

| File/Directory | Description |
|:---  |:--- |
| README.md | this file | 
| Makefile | Makefile driver program |
| dirtree.c | Skeleton for dirtree.c. Implement your solution by editing this file. |
| .gitignore | Tells git which files to ignore |
| doc/ | Doxygen instructions, configuration file, and auto-generated documentation |
| reference/ | Reference implementation |
| tools/ | Tools to generate directory trees for testing |

### Reference implementation

The directory `reference` contains our reference implementation. You can use it to compare your output to ours.

### Tools

The `tools` directory contains tools to generate test directory trees to test your solution.

| File/Directory | Description |
|:---  |:--- |
| gentree.sh | Driver script to generate a test directory tree. |
| mksock     | Helper program to generate a Unix socket. |
| *.tree     | Script files describing the directory tree layout. |

Invoke `gentree.sh` with a script file to generate one of the provided test directory trees. 

**Note:** due to limitations of VirtualBox's shared folder implementation and your host OS, not all file types are supported in the shared folder. We recommand to create the test directories natively inside the VM, for example, in the `work/` directory.

Assuming you are located in the root directory of your I/O lab repository, use the follwing command to generate the `demo` directory tree
```bash
$ ls
dirtree.c  doc  Makefile  README.md  reference  tools
$ tools/gentree.sh tools/demo.tree 
Generating tree from 'tools/demo.tree'...
Done. Generated 4 files, 2 links, 1 fifos, and 1 sockets. 0 errors reported.
```

You can list the contents of the tree with the reference implementation:

## Your Task

Your task is to implement dirtree according to the specification above.

### Design

In a first step, write down the logical steps of your program on a sheet of paper. We will do that together during the first lab session.

**Recommendation**: do not look at the provided code in `dirtree.c` yet! Think about the logical steps yourself. 
The design is the most difficult and important phase in any project - and also the phase that requires the most practice and sets apart hobby programmers from experts.

### Implementation

Once you have designed the outline of your implementation, you can start implementing it. We provide a skeleton file to help you get started.

The skeleton provides data structures to manage the statistics of a directory, a function to read the next entry from a directory while ignoring the '.' and '..' entries, a comparator function to sort the entries of a directory using quicksort, and full argument parsing and syntax helpers. 

You have to implement the following two parts:
1. in `main()`  
   Iterate through the list of directories stored in `directories`. For each directory, call `processDir()` with the appropriate parameters. Also, depending on the output mode, print header, footer, and statistics.
2. in `processDir()`  
   Open, enumerate, sort, and close the directory. Print elements one by one. Update statistics. If the element is a directory, call `processDir()` recursively.

### Hints

#### Skeleton code
The skeleton code is meant to help you get started. You can modify it in any way you see fit - or implement this lab completely from scratch.

#### C library calls

Knowing which library functions exist and how to use them is difficult at the beginning in every programming language. To help you get started, we provide a list of C library calls / system calls grouped by topic that you may find helpful to solve this lab. Read the man pages carefully to learn how exactly the functions operate.

      <td>
        asprintf() is extremely helpful to print into a string and allocate memory for it at the same time.
        We will show some examples during the lab session.

#### Final words

This may well be your first project interacting with the C standard library and system calls. At the beginning, you may feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to approach this task. 

Do not despair - we will give detailed instructions during the lab sessions and provide individual help so that each of you can finish this lab. After completing this lab, you can call yourself a system programmer. Inexperienced still, but anyway a system programmer.
